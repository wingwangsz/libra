## Review guidelines

Review pull requests with a high-recall, production-risk mindset.

Prioritize finding issues that could plausibly cause:
- security exposure
- incorrect behavior
- silent failure
- data corruption or data loss
- backward incompatibility
- production instability
- missing validation or missing tests around changed behavior
- incomplete documentation for externally visible changes

Do not optimize for fewer comments.
If an issue is plausible, user-impacting, and actionable, raise it.

Focus areas:

- Code quality: readability, maintainability, error handling, edge cases, control flow clarity, and failure modes.
- Security: vulnerabilities, unsafe defaults, input validation/sanitization, secrets exposure, auth/authz regressions, injection risks, SSRF/path traversal/deserialization/crypto misuse where relevant.
- Performance: hot-path regressions, N+1 queries, unbounded work, excessive allocations, blocking I/O, memory/resource leaks, missing pagination/batching/caching where impact is likely.
- Testing: missing coverage for changed behavior, weak assertions, missing regression tests, missing edge-case coverage, flaky test risk.
- Documentation: missing or stale code comments, README updates, migration notes, config/env var docs, API/SDK/schema docs, changelog or release notes for externally visible behavior.

## Review output

- Use inline comments for specific issues tied to changed files.
- Use a top-level summary for cross-cutting risks, overall assessment, and praise.
- Order findings by severity, then user impact, then ease of verification.
- For each finding, explain:
  - what is wrong
  - why it matters
  - the realistic impact
  - the minimal fix or direction
- Prefer one clear finding per issue. Avoid combining unrelated concerns.
- Avoid style-only nitpicks unless they create maintainability or correctness risk.
- If no material issues are found, say so briefly and note any residual risk or untested area.

## Severity policy

Treat the following as P0/P1 when applicable:

### P0
- vulnerabilities enabling unauthorized access, data exfiltration, remote code execution, privilege escalation, or destructive data loss
- changes likely to cause major outage, irreversible corruption, or widespread security exposure

### P1
- missing or weakened authentication, authorization, tenancy, or permission checks
- untrusted input reaching dangerous sinks without adequate validation or sanitization
- silent exception swallowing, hidden failure paths, or incorrect fallback behavior
- correctness bugs in business logic, state transitions, retries, idempotency, concurrency, or transaction handling
- backward-incompatible API, schema, contract, or migration changes without explicit handling
- performance regressions likely to affect latency, throughput, reliability, or infrastructure cost in production
- missing tests for changed behavior, bug fixes, edge cases, or critical failure paths
- missing README, migration, configuration, or API documentation for externally visible changes
- unsafe logging of secrets, tokens, PII, or sensitive internal details
- resource lifecycle issues: leaked handles, unreleased locks, missing timeouts, unbounded retries, or unbounded memory growth
- use of `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code (library/command modules, including startup/initialization) — must be replaced with proper error handling (`?`, `anyhow::Context`, `thiserror`) that produces user-friendly error messages. Acceptable only in tests and obviously infallible logic with a `// INVARIANT:` comment; flag all other occurrences

## Trigger rules

When deciding whether to raise a finding, err toward reporting if:
- the change affects auth, permissions, payments, data writes, migrations, caching, concurrency, retries, or external APIs
- the PR changes public behavior but tests or docs were not updated
- error handling changed and failure behavior is not explicitly tested
- a query, loop, or network call is added in a potentially hot path
- defaults changed in a way that could affect security or production behavior
- a fix depends on assumptions not enforced in code
- any new or modified code introduces `unwrap()`, `expect()`, or `panic!()` outside of tests or obviously infallible logic — flag the instance and suggest a `Result`-based alternative with a contextual, user-friendly error message

Do not dismiss an issue only because:
- the diff is small
- the code “probably works”
- the risk depends on a realistic edge case
- the fix would be easy to add later

## Commenting style

- Inline comments: concrete file-specific defects or risks.
- Top-level summary: overall risk, recurring themes, and praise.
- Be direct and specific.
- Prefer actionable recommendations over generic advice.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds the Rust crate (edition 2024). CLI entry `src/main.rs`, library root `src/lib.rs`, CLI definition/dispatch in `src/cli.rs`, shared helpers in `src/common_utils.rs`, `src/git_protocol.rs`, and `src/lfs_structs.rs`.
- `src/command/` contains every `libra <subcommand>` (Git-compatible commands plus Libra-specific commands such as `code`, `code-control`, `automation`, `usage`, `graph`, `sandbox`, `cloud`, `publish`, `db`, and `agent/*`).
- `src/internal/` holds core logic: AI stack in `internal/ai/` (`agent/`, `agent_run/`, `providers/`, `tools/`, `completion/`, `mcp/`, `session/`, `prompt/`, `commands/`, `hooks/`, `intentspec/`, `orchestrator/`, `goal/`, `skills/`, `sandbox/`, `runtime/`, `usage/`, `history.rs`, `libra_vcs.rs`, …); TUI in `internal/tui/`; Sea-ORM models in `internal/model/`; network clients in `internal/protocol/` (`git_client`, `https_client`, `ssh_client`, `lfs_client`, `local_client`); publish pipeline in `internal/publish/`.
- `src/utils/` covers shared utilities: `client_storage.rs` (tiered local + S3/R2 + LRU), `d1_client.rs`, path/object/tree helpers, `ignore.rs`, `lfs.rs`, `fuse.rs`, `convert.rs`, `error.rs`, `output.rs`, `pager.rs`, `text.rs`, `worktree.rs`, `storage/`, `storage_ext.rs`, and `test.rs` (`ChangeDirGuard`, `setup_with_new_libra_in`).
- `tests/` holds integration targets at the top level plus `tests/command/` for per-subcommand suites. `tests/INDEX.md` is the authoritative one-line index of every cargo `--test` target, grouped by Wave (1 command/compat, 2 Code UI & local automation, 3 network, 4 live AI, 5 live cloud, 6 perf smoke); keep it in sync when adding/renaming a test target. Shared helpers live in `tests/command/mod.rs`, `tests/helpers/`, and `tests/harness/`; fixtures live in `tests/data/` and `tests/fixtures/`; `tests/objects/` covers object-level tests; `tests/compat/` covers cross-command compatibility guards.
- `web/` is the Next.js static export embedded into `WebAssets` by `build.rs` and skipped when `LIBRA_SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1` is set. `worker/` holds the Cloudflare Worker (D1 + R2) backing `libra publish` and cloud backup.
- Community docs live in `docs/` (including `docs/development/integration/integration-test-plan.md` and the command development notes under `docs/development/commands/`); SQLite bootstrap lives in `sql/sqlite_20260309_init.sql` plus `sql/sqlite_20260415_ai_runtime_contract.sql`; runtime migrations live in `sql/migrations/`; publish-pipeline schema lives in `sql/publish/`; hooks/templates live in `template/`; release/install assets live in `install.sh`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `cargo +nightly fmt --all` then `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` keep formatting and linting aligned (`rustfmt.toml` sets `group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"` and `imports_granularity = "Crate"`). **CI enforces `-D warnings`; all clippy warnings must be resolved before committing.**
- `cargo build` or `cargo check` for quick compile checks; `cargo run -- <cmd>` exercises the CLI (for example, `cargo run -- status` in a temp repo). Set `LIBRA_SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1` to skip the Next.js export inside `build.rs` during iteration.
- `cargo test --all` runs the default L1 suite. Filter with `cargo test --test command_test` or a specific `tests/command/*` target. Integration cases rely on temp dirs; mark `#[serial]` if they mutate shared state.
- Feature-gated layers (see `tests/INDEX.md` waves; CI `compat-offline-core` covers L1 by default, `compat-network-remotes` runs L2):
  - `--features test-network` for Wave 3 (`network_remotes_test`) — no secrets needed.
  - `--features test-live-ai` for Wave 4 (real LLM APIs; needs `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` etc.).
  - `--features test-live-cloud` for Wave 5 (real D1/R2; needs `LIBRA_D1_*`/`LIBRA_STORAGE_*`).
  - `--features test-provider` plus `LIBRA_ENABLE_TEST_PROVIDER=1` to activate the deterministic provider used by `code_ui_scenarios`, `harness_self_test`, `code_codex_default_tui_test`, `code_ui_remote_lease_matrix`, and `code_ui_remote_sse_matrix` (run with `--test-threads=1`).
  - `--features worktree-fuse` for Unix FUSE-backed worktree commands.
  - `--features subagent-scaffold` for the gated CEX-S2-10 schema scaffold (see `docs/development/tracing/agent.md`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Rust 2024; 4-space indent; snake_case for modules/functions, PascalCase for types, SCREAMING_SNAKE for consts.
- Imports are grouped Std/External/Crate per `rustfmt.toml`; avoid wildcard imports except in tests.
- Prefer `anyhow::Result` for CLI flows and `thiserror` for library errors; keep args parsed via `clap` in `src/command/*`.
- **Avoid `unwrap()` / `expect()`** in production code (including startup/initialization). They are acceptable only in tests and obviously infallible logic (with a `// INVARIANT:` comment). All other code must return `Result` and propagate errors with `?` plus contextual, user-friendly messages.
- **User-friendly errors**: All errors surfaced to the user must be human-readable and actionable — wrap internal errors with context explaining what went wrong, which resource was affected, and how to fix it.
- Add short comments only when control flow is non-obvious (e.g., async handling, SQLite migrations).

## Testing Guidelines
- Favor integration coverage in `tests/command/` (per-subcommand suites) and the top-level `tests/*.rs` targets (AI/runtime/Code-UI/publish/etc.) to mirror real Git and agent workflows; use `tempfile::tempdir()` and `utils::test::ChangeDirGuard` to isolate state.
- `tests/INDEX.md` is the authoritative test index — when adding/renaming a `--test` target, add or update its one-line row (target | wave | purpose | relevant src). Reference specific cases in PRs as `<target>::<test_fn>`.
- Keep fixtures small and local under `tests/data/` or `tests/fixtures/`; re-use helpers in `tests/command/mod.rs`, `tests/helpers/`, and `tests/harness/` instead of shelling out directly.
- Mark tests `#[serial]` (via `serial_test`) if they mutate shared state; keep async tests on Tokio (`#[tokio::test]`, or `flavor = "multi_thread"` when needed). PTY/TUI scenarios under `tests/harness/` plus the `code_ui_*` and `harness_self_test` targets require `--features test-provider` with `LIBRA_ENABLE_TEST_PROVIDER=1` and `--test-threads=1`.
- Pair new commands/options with at least one end-to-end test plus a focused unit test where logic is easily isolated. For new error variants, add a Display-pin test (see the `test(...): pin Display for …` commits) so user-facing messages stay stable.
- When changing compatibility-sensitive help text, docs, or public CLI flags, update the relevant `docs/commands/*.md`, `COMPATIBILITY.md`, `docs/error-codes.md`, and compat tests in the same change.
- When adding or renaming a `tests/compat/*` file, also update `Cargo.toml` and `tests/compat/README.md`; files there do not run unless registered explicitly.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- History uses short, typed summaries with optional scope and PR reference, e.g., `feat(status): support porcelain v2 (#82)` or `fix(push): record tracking reflog (#81)`.
- Commits must include DCO and PGP signing: `git commit -S -s -m "feat(...): ..."`; ensure the `Signed-off-by` trailer is present.
- PRs should state intent, linked issues, and tests run (`cargo +nightly fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, `cargo test --all`, plus any relevant `--features test-*` runs); include repro steps or sample CLI output when touching user-visible behavior. If web/worker code changed, include the matching `pnpm --dir web ...` or `pnpm --dir worker ...` verification.
- Keep changes small and cohesive; update README/CLI docs when adding flags or altering compatibility tables.

## Workspace Notes
- This repository is managed as a single Rust package plus `web/` and `worker/`; it is intentionally used through `libra` commands rather than raw `git` where practical.
- Prefer this command flow for changes: `libra status` -> inspect diff -> `libra add` -> `libra commit -a -s -m "<scope>: ..."` -> `libra push origin <branch>`.
- When a user requests version operations or release copy steps, follow the `libra` command workflow instead of `git` commands.

## Aggressive review bias

Prefer false-positive-tolerant review over false-negative-tolerant review for:
- security-sensitive code
- data mutations
- migrations
- public API changes
- reliability-critical paths

If uncertain between “mention in summary” and “raise as finding”,
raise as a finding when the issue could plausibly reach production.

Treat undocumented assumptions as risk.
Treat untested fixes as incomplete.
Treat externally visible behavior changes without docs as P1 by default.
Flag `unwrap()` / `expect()` in production code (outside tests and obviously infallible logic) as a P1 finding — startup/initialization is a production path and is NOT exempt. Suggest replacing with `?` + contextual, user-friendly error message via `anyhow::Context` or a domain-specific `thiserror` variant. If used in an obviously infallible scope, ensure a brief `// INVARIANT:` comment explains why the value can never be `None`/`Err`.
