# `libra fetch`

Download objects and update remote-tracking refs from another repository.

## Synopsis

```
libra fetch [OPTIONS] [<repository> [<refspec>]]
```

## Description

`libra fetch` contacts a remote repository, negotiates which objects the local store is
missing, downloads them as a pack file, indexes the pack, and updates the corresponding
remote-tracking refs (e.g. `refs/remotes/origin/main`). It never modifies the working
tree or the current branch -- use `libra pull` or `libra merge` for that.

When invoked with no arguments, it fetches from the current branch's configured upstream.
When `--all` is given, every configured remote is fetched in sequence. When a specific
`<repository>` is named, only that remote is contacted. An optional `<refspec>` narrows
the fetch to a single branch.

Fetch supports SSH, HTTPS, local file, and `git://` transports. Vault-backed SSH keys
are loaded automatically when configured via `vault.ssh.<remote>.privkey`.

## Options

| Flag / Argument | Description | Example |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| `<repository>` | Remote name or URL to fetch from. When omitted, uses the current branch's upstream remote. | `libra fetch origin` |
| `<refspec>` | Branch name to fetch. Requires `<repository>`. When omitted, all branches from the remote are fetched. | `libra fetch origin main` |
| `-a`, `--all` | Fetch from every configured remote. Conflicts with `<repository>`. | `libra fetch --all` |
| `--depth <N>` | Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from the tip of each remote branch (shallow fetch). Public stable flag. | `libra fetch origin --depth 1` |
| `--tags` | Fetch every tag from the remote into the local `refs/tags/*` (overrides the default auto-follow and `remote.<name>.tagOpt`). | `libra fetch origin --tags` |
| `--no-tags` | Fetch no tags at all, not even tags reachable from fetched commits (overrides the default auto-follow). | `libra fetch origin --no-tags` |
| `--no-auto-gc` | Do not run a repacking/gc pass after fetching. Accepted no-op for Git parity: Libra's fetch never triggers an automatic gc, so there is nothing to disable. | `libra fetch origin --no-auto-gc` |
| `--no-progress` | Do not show the progress meter (the "Receiving objects" spinner / remote progress) on stderr, matching `git fetch --no-progress`. | `libra fetch origin --no-progress` |
| `-p`, `--prune` | After the fetch, delete remote-tracking refs under `refs/remotes/<remote>/*` that the remote no longer advertises (reusing `remote prune`'s stale classification). Deletions plus an audit reflog entry run in one transaction. Local branches, tags, `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD`, and other remotes are never touched. With `--dry-run`, the stale refs are reported but not deleted. | `libra fetch origin -p` |
| `--no-prune` | Do not prune remote-tracking refs (the default). `--prune`/`--no-prune` form a last-one-wins toggle: when both are given, the last on the command line wins (Git semantics). | `libra fetch origin --no-prune` |
| `--notes` | Also import the file-dependency graph (`refs/notes/deps`, lore.md 3.2) from the remote over a dedicated side-channel. Default OFF (Git never auto-fetches notes). v1 travels notes only from a **local Libra source**; a network or plain-Git remote emits an honest "not supported yet" warning and imports no graph (deferred, D17). Import union-merges into any local edges and re-validates every endpoint, and is per-note fault-tolerant (a malformed note, or one whose commit is absent locally, is skipped with a warning, never aborting the fetch). Persist the opt-in per remote with `remote.<name>.fetchNotesDeps=true`. | `libra fetch origin --notes` |
| `-f`, `--force` | Allow non-fast-forward updates and overwrite (clobber) a local tag that points elsewhere. Forced updates are marked `+` in `--porcelain` / `(forced update)` in human output. | `libra fetch origin --tags --force` |
| `--dry-run` | Preview the remote-tracking ref updates the fetch would produce without downloading any objects or writing refs, reflog, or `FETCH_HEAD`. | `libra fetch origin --dry-run` |
| `--append` | Append fetched ref records to `.libra/FETCH_HEAD` instead of overwriting it. (`-a` is reserved for `--all`.) | `libra fetch origin --append` |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Announce the remote being contacted on stderr; the stdout result contract is unchanged. | `libra fetch origin -v` |
| `--porcelain` | Print a machine-readable `<flag> <old-oid> <new-oid> <local-ref>` line per ref update. Mutually exclusive with `--json`. | `libra fetch origin --porcelain` |
| `--json` | Emit structured JSON envelope to stdout (global flag). | `libra --json fetch origin` |
| `--machine` | Compact single-line JSON; suppresses progress (global flag). | `libra --machine fetch origin` |
| `--progress none` | Suppress NDJSON progress events on stderr in JSON mode. | `libra --json fetch origin --progress none` |
| `--quiet` | Suppress human-readable output. | `libra fetch --quiet` |

## Common Commands

```bash
libra fetch
libra fetch origin
libra fetch origin main
libra fetch --all
libra fetch origin --depth 1               # shallow fetch
libra fetch origin --tags                  # also fetch all tags into refs/tags/*
libra fetch --all --depth 3                # shallow across all remotes
libra fetch origin --dry-run               # preview ref updates, write nothing
libra fetch origin --porcelain             # machine-readable per-ref lines
libra fetch origin -v                      # announce the remote on stderr
libra fetch origin --append                # accumulate into FETCH_HEAD
libra --json fetch origin
libra --json fetch origin --progress none
```

## Network timeouts

A network fetch (`http(s)://`, `git://`, `ssh://`) is bounded by these timeouts
so a dead or black-holed remote cannot hang the command forever:

| Timeout | Default | What it bounds |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| connect | 30s | the TCP (+ TLS) handshake when opening the connection |
| idle    | 60s | the longest gap with no bytes arriving during ref advertisement or pack streaming (it resets whenever data arrives, so a slow-but-steady transfer is not cut off) |
| first-byte | 30s | the wait from sending the `want` list to the first response byte (`NAK` / pack header) — catches a server that accepts the negotiation but never starts streaming, sooner than the idle timeout would. Applied to `git://`; `http(s)`/`ssh` bound the first response through their own read timeouts |

Each is resolved in this precedence order:

1. an environment variable in milliseconds — `LIBRA_FETCH_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`,
   `LIBRA_FETCH_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `LIBRA_FETCH_FIRST_BYTE_TIMEOUT_MS`;
2. a config value in whole seconds — `fetch.<remote>.connectTimeout` /
   `fetch.<remote>.idleTimeout` / `fetch.<remote>.firstByteTimeout`, then the
   un-scoped `fetch.connectTimeout` / `fetch.idleTimeout` / `fetch.firstByteTimeout`;
3. the built-in default above.

```
# Give a flaky remote longer to connect, for this remote only.
libra config fetch.origin.connectTimeout 90

# One-off override (milliseconds) without touching config.
LIBRA_FETCH_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=120000 libra fetch origin
```

Local (`file://` / path) remotes read from disk and are not subject to network
timeouts. `git://` connections are now bounded by all three timeouts (previously
they had none). An unparseable env/config value is ignored rather than applied,
so a typo never leaves a fetch with a zero or nonsensical timeout.

## FETCH_HEAD

Every successful fetch records the fetched refs in `.libra/FETCH_HEAD`, one
`<oid>\tnot-for-merge\tbranch '<name>' of <url>` line per ref. Libra never
designates a merge target (merge with `libra pull`), so every line is marked
`not-for-merge`. `--append` accumulates into the file instead of overwriting it;
`--dry-run` writes nothing.

## Human Output

Successful human mode prints a compact summary:

```text
From /path/to/remote.git
 * [new ref]         origin/main
 32 objects fetched
```

When nothing changed:

```text
From /path/to/remote.git
Already up to date with 'origin'
```

## Structured Output (JSON examples)

- `--json` writes one success envelope to `stdout`
- `--machine` writes the same schema as compact single-line JSON
- `stdout` is reserved for the final envelope only

### Top-Level Schema

- `all`: whether `--all` was used
- `requested_remote`: explicit remote name, or `null` for `--all`
- `refspec`: requested branch/refspec when provided
- `remotes[]`: per-remote fetch results

### Per-Remote Result Schema

- `remote`: logical remote name
- `url`: normalized remote URL/path
- `refs_updated[]`: updated remote-tracking refs
- `objects_fetched`: object count parsed from the received pack
- `bytes_received`: byte size of the received pack stream (0 when nothing was transferred)

### Refs Updated Schema

- `remote_ref`: fully qualified local remote-tracking ref, e.g. `refs/remotes/origin/main`
- `old_oid`: previous object id, or `null` when the ref is new
- `new_oid`: fetched object id

Example (single remote):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "fetch",
  "data": {
    "all": false,
    "requested_remote": "origin",
    "refspec": null,
    "remotes": [
      {
        "remote": "origin",
        "url": "git@github.com:user/repo.git",
        "refs_updated": [
          {
            "remote_ref": "refs/remotes/origin/main",
            "old_oid": "abc1234...",
            "new_oid": "def5678..."
          }
        ],
        "objects_fetched": 32,
        "bytes_received": 4096
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example (already up to date):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "fetch",
  "data": {
    "all": false,
    "requested_remote": "origin",
    "refspec": null,
    "remotes": [
      {
        "remote": "origin",
        "url": "git@github.com:user/repo.git",
        "refs_updated": [],
        "objects_fetched": 0,
        "bytes_received": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Progress

- In `--json` mode, progress defaults to NDJSON events on `stderr`
- Use `--progress none` to keep `stderr` quiet in JSON mode
- `--machine` disables progress automatically and keeps `stderr` clean on success

## Design Rationale

### Pruning is opt-in, not the default

Git ships `fetch.prune = true` as a recommended default because stale remote-tracking
refs accumulate silently. Libra does **not** prune by default for two reasons: (1) in
agent-driven workflows, stale tracking refs can serve as useful historical anchors for
diffing against a previous remote state, and (2) destructive ref cleanup should be a
deliberate choice. Pruning is therefore opt-in via `--prune`/`-p` (or the standalone
`libra remote prune <name>`). `--no-prune` is the default; `--prune`/`--no-prune` form a
last-one-wins toggle, matching Git.

When `--prune` is given, after the fetch completes Libra removes every
`refs/remotes/<remote>/*` ref the remote no longer advertises, classified by the same rule
`remote prune` uses. The deletions and a non-lossy audit reflog entry (`<old> -> 0…0`) run
in a single transaction, so a mid-prune failure rolls back every deletion. `--dry-run`
reports the stale refs without writing. Documented narrowings versus Git: pruning is
**full-remote scoped** (it cleans every stale tracking ref for the remote, like
`remote prune`, rather than restricting to an explicit refspec), it is **skipped entirely
when the remote advertises no refs at all** (so a transient empty advertisement cannot wipe
every tracking ref), and pruned refs never appear in `FETCH_HEAD` (which records only
fetched refs).

### Shallow fetch (`--depth`) is exposed as a stable flag

`libra fetch --depth N` is a public stable flag (audited C3 in
[`docs/development/commands/clone.md`](../development/commands/clone.md)).
The internal `fetch_repository(..., depth)` plumbing has supported shallow fetch
for some time; C3 surfaces it on the CLI and binds the contract:

- `--depth N` limits fetching to the latest `N` commits per remote branch.
- It composes with `--all`: a shallow fetch across all configured remotes is
  `libra fetch --all --depth N`.
- A full-history fetch followed by `fetch --depth N` is idempotent.
- Re-fetching an already-shallow repository at the same depth is also
  idempotent: Libra persists server-advertised shallow boundaries in
  `.libra/shallow` and sends them during later upload-pack negotiation.
- Sparse checkout (`clone --sparse`) is **not** part of this contract — see
  [`docs/development/commands/_compatibility.md`](../development/commands/_compatibility.md)
  for why sparse-checkout is intentionally deferred.

Shallow fetch does introduce the usual Git "shallow boundary" caveats (blame,
log, merge-base computation may not see commits beyond the boundary). That
trade-off is a user-visible knob, not a default — full-history fetch remains
the default and the recommended posture for monorepo and AI-agent workflows.
Tiered cloud storage (S3/R2 + LRU caching) remains the bandwidth solution for
the cases where full history is wanted.

### Why JSON progress on stderr?

Structured progress events (object counts, bytes received) are emitted as NDJSON lines
on stderr so that agent frameworks can parse real-time progress without interfering with
the final result envelope on stdout. This follows the Unix convention of separating status
information (stderr) from data output (stdout). The `--progress none` flag allows callers
that do not need progress to suppress it entirely, and `--machine` mode disables progress
by default for maximum script friendliness.
