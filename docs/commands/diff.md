## Description

`libra diff` shows changes between different states of the repository. By default it compares the index against the working tree (unstaged changes). With `--staged`, it compares HEAD against the index (staged changes). With `--old` and `--new`, it compares two arbitrary commits.

The diff engine supports multiple algorithms (histogram by default, with myers and myersMinimal as alternatives). Output can be directed to a file with `--output`, and several summary formats are available (`--name-only`, `--name-status`, `--numstat`, `--stat`, `--shortstat`, `--summary`). A status-only check is possible with `-s`/`--no-patch` and `--exit-code`, and `-z`/`--null` makes the name/numstat outputs NUL-terminated for safe scripting. `--word-diff[=<mode>]` re-renders the patch at word granularity (matching Git's structure; like all Libra diffs, the exact word grouping can differ from Git on ambiguous changes, and hunk headers keep Libra's unified-diff format).

When the working tree contains unmerged conflict entries, the default working-tree diff renders a conflict-aware `diff --cc <path>` record instead of treating the conflict file as a `/dev/null` addition.

Tracked symlink changes are diffed by the symlink target bytes. The worktree
reader uses `symlink_metadata`/`read_link`, so dangling symlinks are still
diffed as symlinks and are not treated as deleted merely because their targets
do not exist.

Pathspec arguments filter the diff to only show changes in matching files or directories.

When stdout is piped and the downstream command exits early, stdout `BrokenPipe` is treated as
normal pipeline termination; no panic/backtrace or `Broken pipe` diagnostic is printed.

## Options

| Option | Short | Long | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| Old commit | | `--old <COMMIT>` | Specifies the "old" side of the comparison. Defaults to HEAD when `--staged`, or the index otherwise. |
| New commit | | `--new <COMMIT>` | Specifies the "new" side. Requires `--old`. Conflicts with `--staged`. |
| Staged | | `--staged` | Compare HEAD against the index (staged changes). Conflicts with `--new`. |
| Revisions | | positional | Up to two leading revisions, Git-style: `diff A` (A vs worktree), `diff A B` (≡ `A..B`), `diff A..B`, `diff A...B` (merge-base(A,B) vs B), `diff --staged A` (A vs index). Not interpreted when `--old`/`--new` is given. |
| Pathspec | | positional | One or more files or directories to restrict the diff (after any revisions; use `--` to force the path reading). Supports exact files, directory prefixes, default wildcards, and `:(top)` / `:(exclude)` / `:(icase)` / `:(literal)` / `:(glob)` magic. Pre-`--` paths must exist or carry wildcard syntax / supported pathspec magic; post-`--` paths are taken verbatim. |
| Algorithm | | `--algorithm <name>` | Diff algorithm: `histogram` (default), `myers`, or `myersMinimal`. |
| Output file | | `--output <FILENAME>` | Write human-readable output to a file instead of stdout. Ignored in `--json` mode. |
| Name only | | `--name-only` | Show only the names of changed files. |
| Name status | | `--name-status` | Show changed file names with a status letter (A/D/M). |
| Word diff | | `--word-diff[=<mode>]` | Re-render the patch at word granularity. MODE is `plain` (default; removed words `[-…-]`, added `{+…+}`), `color` (highlight in a terminal, no brackets), `porcelain` (one token per line, `-`/`+`/` ` prefixes, `~` for newlines), or `none` (regular patch). Words are whitespace-delimited. Must be written as `--word-diff` or `--word-diff=<mode>`. |
| Numstat | | `--numstat` | Show insertion/deletion counts in a machine-friendly tab-separated format. |
| Stat | | `--stat` | Show a diffstat summary with +/- bar graph. |
| Context lines | `-U<n>` | `--unified=<n>` | Number of context lines around each change in the patch (default 3). Changes only the surrounding context, not the `+`/`-` lines, so `--stat`/`--name-only`/`--numstat` counts are unaffected; the `--json` hunk ranges and line arrays follow `<n>`. |
| Ignore whitespace | `-w` | `--ignore-all-space` | Ignore all whitespace when comparing lines. A change that is only whitespace is not reported (the file drops out if that is its only change); context lines are shown from the new side. Affected files are re-diffed, so `--stat`/`--name-only`/`--numstat`/JSON all reflect the whitespace-ignored result. Honors `-U<n>`. |
| Ignore whitespace amount | `-b` | `--ignore-space-change` | Ignore changes in the *amount* of whitespace: runs of whitespace are treated as a single space and trailing whitespace is ignored, but the presence of whitespace still matters (`a  b` matches `a b`; `a b` still differs from `ab`). Same re-diff/drop behavior as `-w`. `-w` wins if both are given. |
| Ignore EOL whitespace | | `--ignore-space-at-eol` | Ignore whitespace changes at end of line only; leading and internal whitespace compare exactly. Same re-diff/drop behavior as `-w`. `-w`/`-b` win if combined. |
| Ignore EOL carriage return | | `--ignore-cr-at-eol` | Ignore a carriage return at end of line: a CRLF↔LF-only change drops out; a trailing-space or mid-line `\r` change still shows. The weakest whitespace flag — `-w`/`-b`/`--ignore-space-at-eol` each subsume it and win if combined. (Approximation vs Git: ALL trailing CRs are stripped before comparing, rather than Git's non-transitive allow-one-remaining-CR rule — only pathological multi-CR endings like `a\r\r\r` vs `a\r` differ, matching Git on the everyday CRLF cases.) |
| Ignore blank lines | | `--ignore-blank-lines` | Ignore changes whose lines are all blank (truly empty): a change consisting only of added/removed empty lines is not reported (an added/deleted file whose only content is blank lines is still listed with zero counts), while a blank line near a real edit is shown in full. Re-diffs affected files (so `--stat`/`--name-only`/`--numstat`/JSON reflect the result); honors `-U<n>`. Composes with a whitespace flag (`-w`/`-b`/`--ignore-space-at-eol`/`--ignore-cr-at-eol`): under any whitespace flag an all-whitespace line counts as blank (matching Git's `xdl_blankline`). |
| Shortstat | | `--shortstat` | Show only the trailing summary line of `--stat` (files changed / insertions / deletions), omitting a clause when its count is zero. |
| Summary | | `--summary` | Show a condensed summary of created files, deleted files, and (with `-M`) renames (no line for plain content edits); mode-only changes are not surfaced. |
| No patch | `-s` | `--no-patch` | Suppress the patch (diff body). Combine with `--exit-code` for a status-only check. |
| Exit code | | `--exit-code` | Still print the diff, but exit with code 1 when there are differences (0 otherwise). Unlike `--quiet`, the diff is not suppressed. |
| NUL output | `-z` | `--null` | NUL-terminate `--name-only`/`--name-status`/`--numstat` records (and split the `--name-status` status and path into separate NUL fields); other modes are unaffected. |
| Whitespace check | | `--check` | Instead of the diff, warn about safety problems on added lines: trailing whitespace, space-before-tab in the indent, leftover conflict markers, and new blank lines at EOF. Prints `<path>:<line>: <message>` and exits 2 when any are found; takes precedence over other output modes. |
| Reverse | `-R` | `--reverse` | Swap the two sides so additions become deletions and vice-versa (the patch that would undo the change). |
| Text | `-a` | `--text` | Treat all files as text: diff the content even of files detected as binary (a NUL byte in either side, or non-UTF-8 content), suppressing the "Binary files … differ" line. Libra's diff is text-based, so a non-UTF-8 change that is identical after lossy-UTF-8 conversion still shows "Binary files … differ". |
| Binary patch | | `--binary` | Emit a `GIT binary patch` (base85 `literal` chunks for both directions) for binary files instead of "Binary files … differ". The patch is valid and appliable, but its compressed bytes are not byte-identical to Git's (Libra deflates with a different zlib and always emits `literal`, not Git's smaller-of-literal/delta). |
| No external diff | | `--no-ext-diff` | Disable the external diff driver for this run, forcing the built-in engine. |
| External diff | | `--ext-diff` | Allow the configured external diff driver (`diff.external`) to generate each file's patch (it is used by default when configured; this flag is the explicit opposite of `--no-ext-diff`). |
| Color moved lines | | `--color-moved[=<mode>]` | In colored output, color lines that were deleted in one place and added in another with a distinct color (removed → bold magenta, added → bold cyan). Bare `--color-moved` and the block modes (`default`/`zebra`/`blocks`/`dimmed-zebra`) are accepted but approximated by `plain` — every moved line is colored; Libra does not implement Git's conservative moved-block significance/zebra striping. `--color-moved=no` / `--no-color-moved` turns it off. Only affects colored output (a terminal or `--color=always`). |
| No moved-line color | | `--no-color-moved` | Do not color moved lines differently (the default; countermands an earlier `--color-moved`). |
| Find renames | `-M[<n>]` | `--find-renames[=<n>]` | Detect renames: a deleted + added pair whose content is similar enough is reported as one rename (`similarity index N%` / `rename from`/`rename to`, and `R<score>` / `old => new` in the name-status/numstat/summary surfaces). Bare `-M` uses a 50% threshold; `-M<n>` / `-M<n>%` / `--find-renames=<n>` set it (a bare integer is read like Git as `0.<digits>`, so `-M5` is 50% and `-M100%` is exact-only). The similarity index matches Git for typical content (a different chunk hash means contrived hash-collision inputs can differ); when several files are renamed at once the chosen old/new pairings can differ from Git's. Off by default (Libra does not auto-enable via `diff.renames`); a pathspec cannot directly follow a bare `-M`/`--find-renames` — place it before the flag or after `--`. |
| No renames | | `--no-renames` | Turn off rename detection (the default; countermands an earlier `-M`/`--find-renames`). |
| Relative | | `--relative[=<path>]` | Restrict the diff to a directory and show paths relative to it: with a value, `<path>` is resolved from the current directory; bare `--relative` uses the current directory. Files outside the directory are excluded and the prefix is stripped from displayed paths (also in `--stat` and JSON). With an external `diff.external` driver, the file-set restriction still applies but the prefix is NOT stripped from the driver's verbatim output. |
| No relative | | `--no-relative` | Show full repo-root-relative paths. This is Libra's default; accepted for Git parity and takes precedence over `--relative`. |
| No indent heuristic | | `--no-indent-heuristic` | Disable the indent heuristic for hunk boundaries. Accepted no-op: Libra's diff does not apply Git's indent heuristic. (Git's `--indent-heuristic` is not supported.) |
| Textconv | | `--textconv` | Run textconv filters to make content human-diffable: a file whose `diff=<driver>` attribute from Git/Libra attribute sources names a driver with a configured `diff.<driver>.textconv` command has each side converted by that command before diffing. On by default for `diff` (like Git); this flag is the explicit opposite of `--no-textconv`. The resulting patch is for reading, not applying. A failing textconv command is a fatal error; textconv is not applied under `--check` or when `diff.external` is active. |
| No textconv | | `--no-textconv` | Diff the raw content, skipping any textconv filter (countermands an earlier `--textconv`). |
| JSON | | `--json` | Emit structured JSON output. |
| Quiet | | `--quiet` | Suppress stdout; exit code 1 if differences exist, 0 otherwise. When combined with `--output`, the file is still written. |

### Option Details

**`--old` / `--new`**

Compare two specific commits. `--new` requires `--old` to also be specified:

```bash
# Compare two commits
libra diff --old HEAD~3 --new HEAD

# Compare a tag to HEAD
libra diff --old v1.0 --new HEAD
```

**`--staged`**

Show what has been staged for the next commit:

```bash
libra diff --staged
libra diff --staged src/
```

**`--algorithm`**

Select the diff algorithm. Histogram (the default) generally produces more readable diffs for code:

```bash
libra diff --algorithm myers
libra diff --algorithm myersMinimal
```

**`--output`**

Write diff output to a file. Useful for saving diffs for review:

```bash
libra diff --output changes.patch
libra diff --staged --output staged.diff
```

**Summary formats:**

```bash
# Just file names
libra diff --name-only

# File names with status letters
libra diff --name-status
# Output: M	src/main.rs
#         A	src/new_file.rs

# Machine-friendly counts
libra diff --numstat
# Output: 5	2	src/main.rs

# Visual bar graph
libra diff --stat
# Output:  src/main.rs | 7 +++++--
```

## Common Commands

```bash
# Show unstaged changes
libra diff

# Show staged changes
libra diff --staged

# Compare two commits
libra diff --old HEAD~1 --new HEAD

# Show diff stats for a subdirectory
libra diff --stat src/

# Patch with a different amount of context (0, or more than the default 3)
libra diff -U0
libra diff --unified=5 src/main.rs

# Ignore whitespace-only changes (re-indentation shows nothing)
libra diff -w

# Ignore only changes in the amount of whitespace (a  b == a b)
libra diff -b

# Ignore changes that are only blank lines
libra diff --ignore-blank-lines

# Save diff to a file
libra diff --output my.patch

# JSON output for agents
libra --json diff --staged
```

## Human Output

Supported output modes:

- Default unified diff (with ANSI color when terminal is detected)
- `--name-only`
- `--name-status`
- `--numstat`
- `--stat`
- `--shortstat` (just the trailing summary line of `--stat`, with zero-count clauses omitted)
- `--summary` (condensed create/delete/rename summary; renames appear with `-M`, mode-only changes are not surfaced)
- `-s` / `--no-patch` suppresses the patch body (for status-only checks)
- `--exit-code` still prints the diff but exits `1` when there are differences
- `-z` / `--null` NUL-terminates `--name-only`/`--name-status`/`--numstat` records (status and path become separate NUL fields under `--name-status`)
- `--check` scans added lines for trailing whitespace, space-before-tab, leftover conflict markers, and new blank lines at EOF; any hit exits `2`
- `--quiet` suppresses stdout and uses exit `1` to signal that differences exist

Unmerged conflict paths are shown with `diff --cc <path>` headers in the default working-tree diff.

`--output <file>` writes human-readable output to a file. In `--quiet` mode the file is still written, but differences still return exit `1`. In `--json` mode this flag is ignored and output always goes to stdout.

Output is automatically paged when connected to a terminal.

## Structured Output (JSON)

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "diff",
  "data": {
    "old_ref": "index",
    "new_ref": "working tree",
    "files": [
      {
        "path": "tracked.txt",
        "status": "modified",
        "insertions": 1,
        "deletions": 0,
        "hunks": [
          {
            "old_start": 1,
            "old_lines": 1,
            "new_start": 1,
            "new_lines": 2,
            "lines": [" tracked", "+updated"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "total_insertions": 1,
    "total_deletions": 0,
    "files_changed": 1
  }
}
```

The `status` field is one of: `added`, `deleted`, `modified`, or `renamed`. A
`renamed` entry (only produced under `-M`/`--find-renames`) additionally carries
`rename_from` (the original path; `path` holds the new name) and `similarity`
(the similarity index as a whole percent), e.g.:

```json
{
  "path": "src/new.txt",
  "status": "renamed",
  "rename_from": "src/old.txt",
  "similarity": 90,
  "insertions": 1,
  "deletions": 1,
  "hunks": [ /* ... */ ]
}
```

A binary file (unless `--text`) carries `binary` as a `[old_size, new_size]` byte-count pair, its `insertions`/`deletions` are `0`, and `hunks` is empty.

The `old_ref` and `new_ref` fields indicate what was compared (e.g., `"index"`, `"working tree"`, `"HEAD"`, or a commit reference).

## Design Rationale

### Positional revisions and `--old` / `--new`

Git-style positional revisions are supported: `libra diff A` (A vs working tree), `libra diff A B` (identical to `A..B`), `libra diff A...B` (merge-base(A,B) vs B), and `libra diff --staged A` (A vs index). Disambiguation matches Git: everything after `--` is always a path; a pre-`--` token that is both a revision and an existing file is an error (`ambiguous argument '<tok>': both a revision and a filename`), and one that is neither errors with `unknown revision or path not in the working tree` (glob pathspecs like `*.c` are exempt). These errors exit 129 with `LBR-CLI-002`/`LBR-CLI-003` (Libra's CLI-error convention; Git exits 128 here). More than two revisions is rejected — Git ≥2.38's combined-diff form for merges is a declined surface.

The Libra-only named flags (`--old`, `--new`) remain the ambiguity-free programmatic form — when either is given, every positional is a pathspec and no revision interpretation happens at all. This is valuable for AI agents constructing commands: there is exactly one way to express each intent, with no name-collision hazard.

### Why histogram as the default algorithm?

Git defaults to the Myers algorithm for historical reasons. The histogram algorithm (introduced in Git 2.0 as an option) generally produces more readable diffs for source code because it is better at identifying moved blocks and avoids pathological cases with repeated lines. Libra defaults to histogram for better out-of-the-box quality. Myers and myersMinimal remain available for compatibility and edge cases.

### The `--cached` alias

`--cached` is accepted as a Git-compatible visible alias for `--staged` (the canonical Libra spelling, matching `libra status` and `libra restore --staged`).

### Why `--new` requires `--old`?

Allowing `--new` without `--old` would create an ambiguous comparison (new compared to what?). Requiring `--old` when `--new` is specified makes the comparison explicit and predictable. For the common case of comparing against HEAD, use `--staged` instead.

### `--word-diff` and `--color-words`

`--word-diff[=<mode>]` is supported (see the option above): it re-renders the patch at word granularity in `plain` (default), `color`, `porcelain`, or `none` mode, with whitespace-delimited words. The shorthand `--color-words` and a custom `--word-diff-regex` are not yet implemented.
