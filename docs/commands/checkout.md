# `libra checkout`

Show the current branch, switch to an existing branch, create and switch to a new branch, or restore paths through the explicit `--` compatibility form.
Compatible with `git checkout` for common branch operations and explicit path restoration.

## Synopsis

```
libra checkout [<branch>]
libra checkout -
libra checkout -b <name> [<start-point>]
libra checkout -B <name> [<start-point>]
libra checkout --orphan <name>
libra checkout [<tree-ish>] -- <pathspec>...
```

## Description

`libra checkout` is a Git-compatibility surface that delegates to `switch` and `restore` internally. It supports the most common `git checkout` patterns: showing the current branch, switching to an existing branch, returning to the previous checkout target with `-`, creating a new branch with `-b` from HEAD or an explicit start-point, force-creating or resetting a branch with `-B` from HEAD or an explicit start-point, creating an unborn orphan branch with `--orphan`, checking out a commit to enter detached HEAD, auto-tracking remote branches, and restoring paths when an explicit `--` separator is present.

`libra checkout -` shares the worktree-scoped HEAD navigation history used by `switch -`. A branch source follows the current tip of that local branch, while a detached source returns to the full stored commit ID. Repeating the shortcut toggles between targets. Missing, deleted, or corrupt latest navigation targets fail closed without moving HEAD or changing the index/worktree.

This command exists so that developers migrating from Git can use familiar muscle memory. For new workflows, prefer `libra switch` (for branch operations) and `libra restore` (for file operations), which provide richer error messages, structured JSON output, and clearer semantics.

When checking out a branch name that does not exist locally but matches a remote-tracking branch (e.g., `origin/feature`), Libra automatically creates a local tracking branch, sets upstream, and pulls -- going further than Git's auto-track by also synchronizing content immediately.

Path restoration is only enabled by an explicit `--` separator. Without `--`, `libra checkout <name>` is always branch mode, even when a file has the same name. The pathspecs after `--` use the same shared Git-style matcher as `libra restore`: plain prefixes, wildcard pathspecs, and `:(top)`/`:/`/`:(glob)`/`:(literal)`/`:(icase)`/`:(exclude)`/`:!`/`:^` magic are honored. Wildcard-looking pathspecs also match an exact path or directory prefix with the same literal text.

When path restoration materializes a tracked symlink, Libra writes a real
symlink on Unix using the stored link target bytes. Platforms without symlink
support return an explicit unsupported-symlink diagnostic instead of silently
writing a regular file that contains the target path.

After a state-changing checkout, advisory `.libra/hooks/post-checkout` receives
`<old-oid> <new-oid> <flag>`; the flag is `1` for branch/detached checkout and `0`
for path restoration. Showing the current branch or checking out the
already-current branch does not invoke it. Set
`LIBRA_NO_HOOKS=1` only for an explicit policy bypass. See
[Repository hooks](repository-hooks.md).

## Options

| Flag | Long | Value | Description |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| | `<branch>` | positional (optional) | Target branch, or `-` for the previous checkout target. Omit to show current branch. |
| `-b` | | `<name>` | Create a new branch from `[<start-point>]` or the current HEAD and switch to it |
| `-B` | | `<name>` | Force-create a branch from `[<start-point>]` or the current HEAD and switch to it; resets an existing branch to that commit |
| | `[<start-point>]` | positional | Optional commit, tag, or branch used with `-b` / `-B` as the new branch tip |
| | `--orphan` | `<name>` | Create an unborn orphan branch, preserve the index/worktree, and switch HEAD to it. A separate start-point is not supported. |
| `-d` | `--detach` | | Detach HEAD at the named commit even when it is a branch (instead of switching to the branch) |
| `-t` | `--track` | | Set up upstream tracking when checking out a remote-tracking branch. Accepted as a no-op: Libra always configures tracking for a remote-tracking checkout (DWIM), so this requests behavior Libra already performs; no effect for a non-remote target. Use `libra switch --track` for explicit, standalone tracking. |
| | `--ignore-other-worktrees` | | Check out a branch even if another linked worktree has that shared branch checked out; bypasses Libra's other-worktree safety guard. |
| | `--no-progress` | | Do not show a progress meter. Accepted as a no-op: Libra's checkout never renders a progress meter. |
| | `--no-overlay` | | Do not check out paths in overlay mode (paths missing from the source are still removed). Accepted as a no-op: Libra's checkout is never in overlay mode, matching the Git default. (Git's `--overlay` is not implemented.) |
| | `[<tree-ish>] -- <pathspec>...` | positional | Restore paths with shared pathspec magic. Without `<tree-ish>`, restores the worktree from the index. With `<tree-ish>`, restores both index and worktree from that source. |

## Common Commands

```bash
libra checkout                         # Show the current branch
libra checkout main                    # Switch to an existing local branch
libra checkout -                       # Return to the previous checkout target
libra checkout feature-x               # Switch to another branch
libra checkout -b feature-x            # Create and switch to a new branch
libra checkout -b fix-123 abc1234      # Create and switch from a start-point
libra checkout -B feature-x            # Force-create or reset and switch to a branch
libra checkout -B feature-x main       # Reset branch to a start-point and switch
libra checkout --orphan fresh-start    # Create unborn branch; first commit has no parents
libra checkout -- file.txt             # Restore file from index to worktree
libra checkout HEAD -- file.txt        # Restore file from HEAD to index + worktree
libra --json checkout main             # Structured compatibility output
libra checkout --quiet main            # Switch without informational stdout
```

## Human Output

Default human mode writes the result to `stdout`.

Show current branch:

```text
Current branch is main.
```

Show detached HEAD:

```text
HEAD detached at abc1234d
```

Switch to an existing branch:

```text
Switched to branch 'main'
```

Create and switch to a new branch:

```text
Switched to a new branch 'feature-x'
```

When `-b` or `-B` is used with a start-point, the created/reset branch becomes the active symbolic `HEAD` (`refs/heads/<branch>`); Libra does not leave the repository detached after the operation.

Create and switch to an unborn orphan branch:

```text
Switched to a new branch 'fresh-start'
```

After `checkout --orphan`, `HEAD` is a symbolic reference to `refs/heads/<branch>`, but that branch ref does not resolve until the first user commit. The index and working tree are preserved from the previous branch; the first commit has no parents. If the branch already exists, Libra rejects the command without deleting or moving it.

Auto-track a remote branch:

```text
branch 'feature' set up to track 'origin/feature'.
Switched to a new branch 'feature'
Branch 'feature' set up to track remote branch 'origin/feature'
```

Depending on the remote state, the follow-up `pull` step may emit additional
synchronization output.

Already on the target branch (no-op):

```text
Already on main
```

Path restore:

```text
Updated 1 path(s) from HEAD
```

`--quiet` suppresses all `stdout` output.

## Structured Output (JSON)

`checkout` supports `--json` and `--machine` for the compatibility surface. `--json` emits a normal command envelope; `--machine` emits the same envelope as one NDJSON line. Nested `restore`, branch-upstream, and pull output is suppressed so stdout contains only the checkout result.

Example for switching to an existing local branch:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "checkout",
  "data": {
    "action": "switch",
    "previous_branch": "main",
    "previous_commit": "abc1234...",
    "branch": "feature-x",
    "commit": "def5678...",
    "short_commit": "def5678a",
    "switched": true,
    "created": false,
    "pulled": false,
    "already_on": false,
    "detached": false,
    "tracking": null
  }
}
```

| Action | When emitted |
|--------|--------------|
| `show-current` | `libra checkout` with no branch |
| `already-on` | Target branch is already checked out |
| `switch` | Existing local branch checkout |
| `create` | `checkout -b <branch> [<start-point>]`, `checkout -B <branch> [<start-point>]`, or `checkout --orphan <branch>` |
| `track` | Local branch is created from `origin/<branch>` and pull is attempted |
| `restore-paths` | Explicit `checkout [<tree-ish>] -- <pathspec>...` path restoration |

Remote auto-track output sets `created: true`, `pulled: true`, and includes `tracking.remote` plus `tracking.remote_branch`.

For `checkout --orphan`, `action` is `create`, `created` is `true`, `branch` is the unborn branch name, and `commit` / `short_commit` are `null` until the first user commit creates the branch ref.

For richer branch workflows, `libra switch --json ...` remains the preferred structured command. For file workflows, `libra restore --json ...` remains preferred; checkout path mode is only a Git-compatible alias.

Example for path restoration:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "checkout",
  "data": {
    "action": "restore-paths",
    "previous_branch": "main",
    "branch": "main",
    "switched": false,
    "restore": {
      "source": "HEAD",
      "worktree": true,
      "staged": true,
      "restored_files": ["src/main.rs"],
      "deleted_files": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Design Rationale

### Why keep checkout as a compatibility command?

Git muscle memory is deeply ingrained. Developers who have used `git checkout` for years will instinctively type `libra checkout main`. Rather than forcing an immediate mental model change, Libra provides `checkout` as a thin wrapper that handles the most common patterns. This lowers the adoption barrier while the recommended `switch`/`restore` split is documented and encouraged.

The command intentionally keeps file restoration behind Git's explicit `--` separator. Plain `libra checkout <name>` remains branch mode; `libra checkout -- <path>` and `libra checkout <tree-ish> -- <path>` are compatibility aliases for the corresponding `restore` operations.

### Visible compatibility surface (post-C5)

`checkout` is exposed in top-level help (`libra --help`) as a compatibility
surface — it is **no longer hidden**. New users coming from Git can find it
without surprise, but the help banner and the command index both steer
day-to-day usage to `switch` (branch navigation) and `restore` (file
restoration). `switch` and `restore` provide:

- Typed command-specific error enums and stable error codes
- Structured JSON output (`--json` / `--machine`)
- Fuzzy branch suggestions on typos
- Explicit semantics (no ambiguity between "switch branch" and "restore file")

### Why auto-pull on remote branch?

When `libra checkout feature` finds `origin/feature` but no local `feature` branch, it creates the local branch, sets upstream tracking, and immediately pulls. This goes beyond Git's behavior (which only creates the tracking branch without pulling). The rationale:

- **Trunk-based development**: in Libra's target workflow, checking out a remote branch implies intent to work on it, so having the latest content is almost always desired.
- **Fewer commands for agents**: an AI agent checking out a remote branch wants working content immediately, not an empty tracking branch that requires a separate `pull`.
- **Fail-fast**: if the pull fails (network error, merge conflict), the user learns immediately rather than discovering stale content later.

## Parameter Comparison: Libra vs Git vs jj

| Feature | Git | Libra | jj |
|---------|-----|-------|----|
| Show current branch | `git branch --show-current` | `libra checkout` (no args) | `jj log -r @` |
| Switch branch | `git checkout main` | `libra checkout main` | `jj edit <rev>` |
| Previous checkout target | `git checkout -` | `libra checkout -` | N/A |
| Create and switch | `git checkout -b feature` | `libra checkout -b feature` | `jj new` + `jj branch create` |
| Create from commit | `git checkout -b fix abc1234` | `libra checkout -b fix abc1234` | `jj new abc1234` + `jj branch create fix` |
| Force-create / reset branch | `git checkout -B feature main` | `libra checkout -B feature main` | N/A |
| Auto-track remote | `git checkout feature` (creates tracking) | `libra checkout feature` (creates tracking + pulls) | N/A |
| Restore files | `git checkout -- file` | `libra checkout -- file` (prefer `libra restore file`) | `jj restore` |
| Restore files from revision | `git checkout HEAD -- file` | `libra checkout HEAD -- file` (prefer `libra restore --source HEAD -S -W file`) | `jj restore --from <revision>` |
| Detach HEAD | `git checkout <commit>` / `git checkout --detach <branch>` | `libra checkout <commit>` / `libra checkout -d`/`--detach <branch>` | `jj edit <rev>` |
| Track remote branch | `git checkout -t`/`--track <remote>/<branch>` | `libra checkout -t`/`--track` (accepted no-op; DWIM always tracks) | N/A |
| Structured output | No | `--json` / `--machine` for branch compatibility actions | `--template` |

## Error Handling

`checkout` has a typed `CheckoutError` for checkout-owned failures and delegates path restore failures to `restore` while preserving stable codes.

| Scenario | Stable code | Message | Exit |
|----------|-------------|---------|------|
| Dirty worktree (unstaged or staged changes) | `LBR-REPO-003` | "local changes would be overwritten by checkout" | 128 |

| Branch or start-point not found (no remote match) | `LBR-CLI-003` | "path specification '{name}' did not match any files known to libra" | 129 |
| No resolvable previous checkout target | `LBR-CLI-003` | "no previous checkout target is available" | 129 |
| Previous checkout reflog read failed | `LBR-IO-001` | "failed to read the current worktree HEAD reflog: ..." | 128 |
| Previous checkout record is malformed or unreadable | `LBR-REPO-002` | "the current worktree HEAD navigation record is invalid: ..." | 128 |
| Pathspec not matched in path mode | `LBR-CLI-003` | "pathspec '{path}' did not match any files" | 128 |
| `-b` combined with path mode | `LBR-CLI-002` | "checkout path mode cannot be combined with -b" | 128 |
| Current branch (no-op) | N/A | Prints "Already on {branch}" and succeeds | 0 |
| Branch storage query failure | `LBR-IO-001` | "failed to resolve checkout target: {detail}" | 128 |
| Corrupt branch reference | `LBR-REPO-002` | "failed to resolve checkout target: {detail}" | 128 |
