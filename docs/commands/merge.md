# `libra merge`

Merge one target into the current branch.

## Synopsis

```text
libra merge [--ff-only | --no-ff | --squash | --no-commit] [-m <msg>] [--no-edit] [--stat | -n | --no-stat] [--verify-signatures | --no-verify-signatures] [--no-rerere-autoupdate] [--no-gpg-sign] [--dry-run] [--autostash | --no-autostash] <branch>
libra merge --continue
libra merge --abort
libra merge --restart
```

## Description

`libra merge <branch>` resolves a local branch, commit hash, or remote-tracking ref such as `refs/remotes/origin/main`.

If the current branch can be fast-forwarded, Libra moves the branch pointer to the target commit and restores the index and working tree. If the branches have diverged, Libra performs a single-head three-way merge using the merge base.

Clean three-way merges create a two-parent merge commit, update HEAD, rebuild the index, restore the working tree, and write a merge reflog entry. Conflicting three-way merges write line-level conflict markers to the working tree (matching Git — only the diverging hunks are enclosed between `<<<<<<< HEAD` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>`, with shared context left outside; binary or modify/delete paths fall back to whole-file markers), write unmerged index stages, save Libra merge state, and return `LBR-CONFLICT-002` with hints for `libra merge --continue` and `libra merge --abort`.

### Conflict style (`merge.conflictStyle`)

The marker format follows the Git-compatible `merge.conflictStyle` config key (config-only — matching Git, `merge` has no CLI style flag):

```bash
libra config merge.conflictStyle diff3
```

- `merge` (default, or unset) — the two-marker style above.
- `diff3` — additionally emits the common-ancestor content between a `||||||| base` marker and the `=======` separator, so you can see what both sides started from.
- Any other value — including the unimplemented `zdiff3` — is a hard error when a conflict must be rendered (exit 128), never a silent fall-back to the default style.

The config is honored by both `libra merge` and `libra cherry-pick` for line-level text conflicts. Binary and modify/delete conflicts keep their two-part whole-file presentation (Git also emits no base block there), and `libra rebase` currently renders whole-file markers without a base block regardless of this setting.

Libra still does not implement octopus merges, custom strategies, strategy options, or interactive message editing (`--edit`/launching an editor). Signature verification (`--verify-signatures`) is supported but limited to the local vault PGP key (no external GPG keyring).

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<branch>` | Target branch, commit, or remote-tracking ref to merge. |
| `-m, --message <MSG>` | Override the merge commit message (default `Merge <branch> into <head>`). |
| `--ff-only` | Refuse to merge unless the current branch can be fast-forwarded. |
| `--no-ff` | Always create a two-parent merge commit, even when a fast-forward is possible. |
| `--squash` | Produce the merged index/working tree but create no commit and do not move HEAD; finish with a plain `libra commit`. |
| `--no-commit` | Perform the merge and stage the result but stop before committing; finish with `libra merge --continue`. |
| `--no-edit` | Accept the auto-generated merge message without launching an editor. Libra never opens an editor for merge, so this is a no-op accepted for Git parity. |
| `--stat` | Show a diffstat of the merge result (the changes between the pre-merge HEAD and the new commit) after the merge completes. Git shows this by default; Libra defaults to no diffstat, so `--stat` opts in. Last-one-wins toggle with `--no-stat`/`-n`. Human output only. |
| `-n`, `--no-stat` | Do not show a diffstat at the end of the merge (Libra's default). Last-one-wins toggle with `--stat`. |
| `--no-progress` | Do not show a progress meter. No-op accepted for Git parity: Libra's merge never renders a progress meter. |
| `--verify-signatures` | Verify the PGP signature on the tip commit of the merged branch and abort the merge if it is unsigned or the signature is bad. Like `tag -v`, only signatures made by this repository's vault PGP key can be validated (no external GPG keyring), so a commit signed elsewhere — or with an SSH signature — is treated as not verifiable. |
| `--no-verify-signatures` | Do not verify the merged commit's signature (the default). The inverse of `--verify-signatures`; the last one wins. |
| `--no-rerere-autoupdate` | Do not update the rerere index after the merge. No-op accepted for Git parity: Libra has no rerere. (Git's `--rerere-autoupdate` is not exposed.) |
| `--no-gpg-sign` | Do not GPG-sign the merge commit. No-op accepted for Git parity: Libra's merge never signs. (Git's `-S`/`--gpg-sign` is not implemented.) |
| `--continue` | Finish an in-progress merge after conflicts have been resolved and staged. |
| `--abort` | Restore the pre-merge HEAD, index, and working tree (re-applies a held autostash). |
| `--autostash` / `--no-autostash` | Stash local tracked changes (incl. staged) before the merge and re-apply them when it concludes — held (outside `stash list`) across a conflict until `--continue`/`--abort`; a conflicting re-apply is saved to the stash list with a notice, never lost. Config: `merge.autostash` (boolean; invalid value = hard error). Untracked files are not stashed (Git parity). `--json` adds `autostash: applied\|stashed\|kept`. |
| `--dry-run` | Libra extension: preview the merge outcome writing **nothing** — reports fast-forward / already-up-to-date / clean three-way / would-conflict (with the paths). Exits 0 for a clean preview, 1 when the merge would conflict. Mutually exclusive with `--continue`/`--abort`/`--restart`/`--squash`/`--no-commit`. |
| `--restart` | Libra extension (ports Lore's `branch merge restart`): abort the in-progress conflicted merge — discarding any resolution work, exactly like `--abort` — then immediately re-run the same merge against the recorded target commit, regenerating fresh conflict markers and state. Takes no branch and no merge options (the original `-m`/`--no-ff`/… are not replayed). Requires a **conflicted** merge: a staged `--no-commit` merge is refused (finish it with `--continue` or discard with `--abort`). |
| `--json` | Emit a structured success envelope. |
| `--machine` | Emit the same structured envelope as one compact JSON line. |
| `--quiet` | Suppress human success output. |

## Common Commands

```bash
libra merge feature-x
libra merge refs/remotes/origin/main
libra merge --continue
libra merge --abort
libra merge --dry-run feature-x
libra merge --restart
libra merge --json feature-x
```

## Conflict Lifecycle

When a merge conflicts:

1. Edit files containing conflict markers.
2. Stage each resolved path with `libra add <path>`.
3. Run `libra merge --continue` to create the two-parent merge commit.

Run `libra merge --abort` before continuing to restore the branch, index, and working tree to the pre-merge commit. `libra status` shows the in-progress merge target and the continue/abort commands while merge state exists.

To throw away a botched resolution attempt and start over in one step, run `libra merge --restart`: it restores the pre-merge state exactly like `--abort` (any edits to conflicted files are **discarded**) and immediately re-runs the same merge against the recorded target commit — deterministic even if the branch has moved since — leaving fresh conflict markers and a fresh merge state. The re-run uses default merge options.

## Dry Run

`libra merge --dry-run <branch>` (a Libra extension — Git has no true merge dry-run) reports what the merge *would* do without writing anything: no HEAD, index, working-tree, reflog, merge-state, or object-store mutation (auto-merged blobs are computed in memory only). Because it is read-only it also works on a dirty working tree — note the preview does not validate cleanliness, so a real merge may still refuse where the preview succeeded.

Outcomes and exit codes:

| Preview outcome | Human output | Exit |
|-----------------|--------------|------|
| Fast-forward possible | `Would fast-forward` | 0 |
| Already up to date | `Already up to date.` | 0 |
| Clean three-way merge | `Would merge cleanly by the 'three-way' strategy.` | 0 |
| Would conflict | `Would conflict in: <paths>` | 1 |

The would-conflict exit of 1 is an outcome signal (like `merge-file` and `diff --exit-code`), deliberately distinct from the 128 a *real* conflicting merge exits with — the preview itself succeeded. With `--json`/`--machine` the summary carries `"dry_run": true` and, when conflicting, `"would_conflict": true` plus `conflicted_paths`; both keys are absent from every real merge's output (frozen schema).

## Human Output

Fast-forward:

```text
Fast-forward
```

Clean three-way merge:

```text
Merge made by the 'three-way' strategy.
```

Already up to date:

```text
Already up to date.
```

After `--continue`:

```text
Merge completed.
```

After `--abort`:

```text
Merge aborted.
```

Conflict errors are printed through Libra's standard structured error envelope on stderr and include recovery hints.

## JSON / Machine Output

Success output keeps the historical `files_changed` numeric field and adds merge-lifecycle fields only when relevant.

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "merge",
  "data": {
    "strategy": "three-way",
    "old_commit": "abc1234...",
    "commit": "def5678...",
    "files_changed": 2,
    "up_to_date": false,
    "parents": ["abc1234...", "fedcba9..."]
  }
}
```

Already-up-to-date merges use `strategy: "already-up-to-date"`, `commit: null`, `files_changed: 0`, and `up_to_date: true`.

`--abort` sets `aborted: true`; `--continue` sets `continued: true`. Conflict failures return an error envelope on stderr with `LBR-CONFLICT-002`.
