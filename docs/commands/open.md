# `libra open`

Resolve a remote URL into a web URL and optionally launch the system browser.

## Synopsis

```
libra open [<remote>]
```

## Description

`libra open` determines the web-browsable URL for a repository and, in human-output
mode, opens it in the default system browser. The command accepts an optional
positional argument that can be either a configured remote name (e.g. `origin`) or a
direct URL.

When no argument is given, the command tries the following in order:
1. The current branch's configured upstream remote.
2. A remote named `origin`.
3. The first configured remote (alphabetically).

If the resolved URL uses SSH or SCP syntax (`git@host:path` or `ssh://...`), it is
automatically transformed to an HTTPS URL. The final URL is validated to ensure it
uses `http://` or `https://` before being passed to the OS browser launcher. This
prevents local file access, `javascript:`, or other injection vectors.

On macOS the command uses `open`, on Linux `xdg-open`, and on Windows `cmd /C start`.

## Options

| Flag / Argument | Description | Example |
|-----------------|-------------|---------|
| `<remote>` | Remote name or direct URL. When omitted, auto-detects from tracking config or `origin`. | `libra open origin` |
| `--json` | Emit structured JSON envelope to stdout instead of opening a browser (global flag). | `libra open --json` |
| `--machine` | Compact single-line JSON without launching a browser (global flag). | `libra open --machine` |
| `--quiet` | Suppress the "Opening ..." message on stdout. | `libra open --quiet` |

## Common Commands

```bash
libra open
libra open origin
libra open https://github.com/libra-tools/libra
libra open --json
```

## Human Output

```text
Opening https://github.com/libra-tools/libra
```

`--quiet` suppresses `stdout`.

## Structured Output (JSON examples)

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "open",
  "data": {
    "remote": "origin",
    "remote_url": "git@github.com:libra-tools/libra.git",
    "web_url": "https://github.com/libra-tools/libra",
    "launched": false
  }
}
```

When the argument is a direct URL instead of a remote name, `remote` is `null`:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "command": "open",
  "data": {
    "remote": null,
    "remote_url": "https://github.com/libra-tools/libra",
    "web_url": "https://github.com/libra-tools/libra",
    "launched": false
  }
}
```

### Schema Notes

- `remote` is the logical remote name, or `null` when a direct URL was provided
- `remote_url` is the raw URL from config (or the direct URL argument)
- `web_url` is the transformed browsable HTTPS URL
- `launched` is `true` when the browser was successfully spawned in human mode
- `launched` is `false` for `--json` / `--machine`, where browser launch is intentionally skipped

### URL Transformation Rules

| Input Format | Transformed Output |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `https://github.com/user/repo.git` | `https://github.com/user/repo` |
| `http://github.com/user/repo.git` | `http://github.com/user/repo` |
| `git@github.com:user/repo.git` (SCP) | `https://github.com/user/repo` |
| `ssh://git@github.com/user/repo.git` | `https://github.com/user/repo` |
| `ssh://user@host.com:2222/repo.git` | `https://host.com/repo` |

## Design Rationale

### Why support direct URLs?

The primary use case for `libra open` is quickly jumping to a repository's web interface.
Sometimes a developer or agent has a URL from a chat message, issue tracker, or log output
and wants to open it without first configuring a remote. Accepting direct URLs alongside
remote names makes the command a universal "open this repo in the browser" tool. If the
argument matches a configured remote name, that takes precedence; otherwise it is treated
as a literal URL. This dual-mode behavior eliminates a common friction point without
adding complexity.

### Why not just use `git web--browse`?

`git web--browse` is an internal Git helper that launches a browser but has several
limitations: it does not transform SSH/SCP URLs to HTTPS, it does not validate URL
safety, and it requires the `instaweb` or `browse` helpers to be configured. Libra's
`open` command handles the full URL transformation pipeline (SCP to HTTPS, SSH to HTTPS,
`.git` suffix stripping) and validates that the final URL uses a safe scheme before
passing it to the OS launcher. This makes it work out-of-the-box for all common remote
URL formats without additional configuration.

### Why URL safety validation?

When a remote URL is transformed and passed to an OS command (`open`, `xdg-open`,
`cmd /C start`), there is a risk of command injection or unintended file access if the
URL uses a scheme like `file://`, `javascript:`, or contains shell metacharacters. Libra
validates that the final URL uses only `http://` or `https://` before launching the
browser. On Windows, the URL is additionally quoted to prevent `cmd.exe` metacharacter
expansion. This defense-in-depth approach protects against both accidental misconfiguration
and deliberate attacks via crafted remote URLs.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | StableErrorCode | Exit | Hint |
|----------|-----------------|------|------|
| Not in a repo and no explicit URL | `LBR-REPO-001` | 128 | "run this command inside a libra repository, or pass a URL" |
| No remote configured | `LBR-REPO-003` | 128 | "add a remote first: 'libra remote add origin \<url>'" |
| Remote configured but has no URL | `LBR-REPO-003` | 128 | "configure the URL: 'libra config set remote.\<name>.url \<url>'" |
| Resolved URL is unsafe or invalid | `LBR-CLI-003` | 129 | "pass an explicit https:// URL or configure a supported remote URL" |
| Failed to read remote config | `LBR-IO-001` | 128 | -- |
| Failed to launch browser | `LBR-IO-002` | 128 | "check that a default browser is configured" |
