# `libra hooks`

Internal entry point invoked by external AI agent hook configurations
that capture lifecycle events (session start, prompt submission, tool
use, model updates, compaction, stop, session end) into the libra
session store. Operators almost never type `libra hooks ...` directly —
the hook configs installed by `libra agent enable` reference these
sub-commands.

## Synopsis

```
libra hooks claude   {session-start|prompt|tool-use|model-update|compaction|stop|session-end}
libra hooks codex    {session-start|prompt|tool-use|model-update|compaction|stop|session-end|subagent-start|subagent-end}
libra hooks gemini   <event>   # rejected with a hint: gemini is uninstall-only (AG-17)
```

## Description

`libra hooks` is the **hidden** (`hide = true` in clap) compatibility
surface invoked by Claude Code / Gemini hook configs. Each invocation
reads a single hook event payload as JSON on stdin, validates it
against the provider-specific schema, and records the redacted
projection into the active `.libra/sessions/{id}/session.jsonl`.

The command is hidden because:

- It is not part of the user-facing CLI contract — it must remain
  invocable by hook configs whose format is owned by the upstream
  provider (Claude Code / Gemini), not by Libra. Treating it as a
  public surface would require freezing the JSON payload schema
  Libra-side, which is impossible because the providers can change
  the payload at any release.
- The events it produces are read by `libra agent session list`,
  `libra agent checkpoint *`, and `libra agent doctor`. The public
  surface for inspecting captured sessions is the `agent` sub-command
  ([agent.md](agent.md)), not `hooks`.

`libra hooks codex <verb>` (AG-19) is the stable surface written into
`$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` by `libra agent enable --agent codex`; unlike
the historical claude routing above it records into the AgentTraces
capture store (`refs/libra/traces`). Codex additionally emits native
sub-agent boundaries (`subagent-start` / `subagent-end`).

`libra hooks gemini <verb>` no longer ingests: gemini is uninstall-only
(AG-17), so stale hook configs installed before the demotion get an
actionable error pointing at `libra agent remove gemini` instead of
silently capturing data.

To enable capture, run `libra agent enable --agent <name>` for a
supported roster agent; this installs the provider hook config.
To disable capture, run `libra agent disable --agent <name>`.

## Providers and Events

Both providers expose the same seven Claude-Code-style lifecycle
events:

| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `session-start` | New session opened (provider startup or `/new` slash) |
| `prompt` | User submitted a prompt (UserPromptSubmit hook) |
| `tool-use` | Tool invocation (PreToolUse / PostToolUse hook) |
| `model-update` | Model swap inside a turn |
| `compaction` | Provider compacted its in-memory context |
| `stop` | User pressed Esc / hit the Stop button mid-turn |
| `session-end` | Session closed cleanly |

Each event reads its provider-specific JSON payload from stdin, runs
the redaction pipeline (secrets / tokens / file content >256 KiB), and
appends an `AgentTraceEvent` JSONL record into the active session
store. The hook returns exit code 0 unless the payload fails to parse
— provider hooks must never block on Libra-side processing.

## Options

`libra hooks` takes no flags besides the global ones (`--json`,
`--quiet`, etc.). The event kind is selected by the positional
sub-command path.

## Examples

```bash
# Claude Code SessionStart hook (typical hook config invocation)
libra hooks claude session-start

# Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook
libra hooks claude prompt

# Claude Code PreToolUse / PostToolUse hook
libra hooks claude tool-use

# Claude Code Stop hook
libra hooks claude stop

# Claude Code SessionEnd hook
libra hooks claude session-end

# Gemini SessionStart hook
libra hooks gemini session-start
```

The Claude Code hook config installed by `libra agent enable --agent
claude` looks roughly like:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{"command": "libra hooks claude session-start"}],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{"command": "libra hooks claude prompt"}],
    "PreToolUse": [{"command": "libra hooks claude tool-use"}],
    "PostToolUse": [{"command": "libra hooks claude tool-use"}],
    "Stop": [{"command": "libra hooks claude stop"}],
    "SessionEnd": [{"command": "libra hooks claude session-end"}]
  }
}
```

## Related Commands

- `libra agent enable` / `libra agent disable` — install / uninstall
  the provider hook config that invokes `libra hooks`.
- `libra agent status` — show capture coverage and the most recent
  hook timestamps.
- `libra agent session list` / `libra agent checkpoint list` — inspect
  events recorded by `libra hooks`.
- `libra agent doctor` — diagnose hook installation problems.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Event recorded (or silently skipped because capture is disabled / the session is unknown) |
| `1` | The stdin payload failed schema validation; the hook caller may surface a warning, but provider hook flows treat this as non-fatal |
| `128` | Fatal initialization error before any payload could be processed |
