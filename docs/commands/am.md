# `libra am`

Apply one or more plain-text `format-patch` mail files as commits. The files
are processed in the order given, preserving each mail's subject/body, author,
and `Date:` metadata while using the current Libra identity as committer.

## Synopsis

```text
libra am <patch>...
libra am --continue
libra am --skip
libra am --abort
```

## Behavior

A new series requires a local branch with an existing commit and no staged or
tracked working-tree changes. Unrelated untracked files are preserved, but any
existing non-index path that a mail would touch—including an ignored path—is
rejected before sequencer state is saved. The aggregate mail input is limited
to 64 MiB and 10,000 files.

The minimal mail parser accepts UTF-8, single-part messages with `7bit`, `8bit`,
`binary`, quoted-printable, or base64 transfer encoding. It reads `From:`,
`Date:`, and `Subject:`, removes a leading `[PATCH ...]` subject marker, honors
the standard in-body `From:` override, and extracts the text `diff --git`
section after the `---` separator. UTF-8/US-ASCII RFC 2047 `B` and `Q` encoded
words are decoded.

Every target is checked against absolute paths, empty/`.`/`..` components, NUL
bytes, `.libra/`, and existing symlink path components. All files in one mail are test-applied before
the first write. File replacements use atomic rename and content patches retain
the existing permission bits.

Sequencer state is saved before worktree writes. Each successful commit moves
the branch, writes its reflog, and advances or clears the `am` position in one
SQLite transaction. Resume and skip reject a branch whose tip moved outside
the sequencer. If interruption occurs after state is saved but before the
current mail writes anything—including between two commits—`--continue`
retries that mail. `--abort` resets the original branch tip, index, and tracked
worktree, and also removes a new-file target left by an interruption before it
was staged.

## Conflict recovery

This minimal version does not synthesize three-way conflict markers. When a
patch does not apply, it leaves the current branch tip unchanged and keeps the
series resumable:

1. resolve the affected paths manually;
2. stage only paths named by the current patch with `libra add`;
3. run `libra am --continue`.

Use `--skip` to discard the current patch and continue with the next one, or
`--abort` to discard the entire series and restore the pre-`am` state.

## Options

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--continue` | Commit the fully staged resolution and continue. Unstaged current-patch paths, unrelated tracked changes, unresolved index entries, an empty resolution, or staged unrelated paths are rejected. A pristine recovery state retries the current mail. |
| `--skip` | Reset the current patch and continue with the remaining mails. |
| `--abort` | Restore the original branch tip, index, and tracked worktree and clear the sequencer. |
| `--json` / `--machine` | Emit the action, applied source files/subjects/commit IDs, and optional restored HEAD in the standard envelope. |

## Examples

```bash
# Generate and replay a series
libra format-patch -o outgoing origin/main..HEAD
libra switch target
libra am outgoing/0001-*.patch outgoing/0002-*.patch

# Resolve a stopped patch
$EDITOR src/lib.rs
libra add src/lib.rs
libra am --continue

# Cancel the complete series
libra am --abort
```

## Current limitations

This is the P2-01 minimal surface, not full Git `am` parity. It does not accept
stdin, mbox files containing multiple messages, MIME multipart/attached
patches, binary patches, rename-only or mode-only patches, or Git's wider flag
set (`-3`/`--3way`, `--signoff`, `--keep`, `--scissors`, and others). Existing
file permissions are retained for content patches, but mail mode changes are
not applied. Applypatch/commit hooks are not run. `mailinfo` is not yet exposed
as a separate command.
