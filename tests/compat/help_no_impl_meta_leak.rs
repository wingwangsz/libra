//! `tests/compat/help_no_impl_meta_leak.rs` — surface contract that
//! `libra <cmd> --help` never leaks implementation-detail rustdoc
//! into the user-facing help body.
//!
//! Background: clap derives `long_about` from the second-line-onward
//! of an `Args` struct's `///` doc comment. If a contributor adds a
//! contributor-facing note as a second `///` line — e.g.
//!
//!     /// Stage file contents for the next commit.
//!     ///
//!     /// See `libra add --help` for the same EXAMPLES rendered through clap.
//!     #[derive(Parser, ...)]
//!     pub struct AddArgs { ... }
//!
//! that second line is shown verbatim in `libra add --help`. The
//! reader is *already in* `--help`, so the meta-commentary is
//! useless to them and obscures the actual command summary. v0.17.888
//! repaired the same class of leak on `libra worktree --help`
//! ("CLI arguments for the `worktree` subcommand. This type is wired
//! into the top-level CLI…"). v0.17.894 repaired three more
//! (`add`, `status`, `pull`).
//!
//! This guard codifies the rule across the entire visible-command
//! surface: any `<cmd> --help` body that contains one of the known
//! meta-leak phrases fails the test with a pointer at the
//! `src/command/<cmd>.rs` doc comment to fix.
