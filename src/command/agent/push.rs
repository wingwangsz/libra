//! `libra agent push [--remote <name>] [--force-rewrite]` transport wrapper.
//!
//! The external-agent capture catalogue lives on the local
//! `traces` branch, but the remote contract reserves
//! `refs/libra/traces` so it does not appear as a user branch.
//!
//! AG-20 push-after-prune contract (plan.md Task A5, option (a) — no new
//! stable error code): `refs/libra/traces` is Libra-managed and an
//! `agent clean` prune rewrites the whole chain, so the follow-up push is
//! never fast-forward. Without `--force-rewrite` the rejection carries an
//! actionable hint pointing at the flag; with it the push runs under
//! `--force-with-lease=refs/libra/traces:<last-pushed-tip>` — never an
//! unconditional force — so a remote that moved behind our back (another
//! machine pushed its own rewrite) still fails closed. The "last pushed
//! tip" lease basis is the remote-tracking row this wrapper records after
//! every successful push (the core push pipeline only auto-tracks
//! `refs/heads/*`).
