//! Branch management subcommand (`libra branch`).
//!
//! Implements creation, deletion, listing, renaming, upstream tracking, and
//! current-branch reporting. The single [`run_branch`] entry inspects the
//! parsed [`BranchArgs`] and delegates to one of the `*_impl` helpers.
//!
//! Non-obvious responsibilities:
//! - Maps [`branch::BranchStoreError`] to the local [`BranchError`] domain so
//!   the CLI surface is decoupled from the storage layer; see
//!   `map_branch_store_error`.
//! - For deletes, walks reachable commits from HEAD via
//!   [`get_reachable_commits`] to detect "not fully merged" branches before
//!   permitting deletion (skipped under `-D`).
//! - Suggests near-matches via Levenshtein distance when the user names a
//!   missing branch.
//! - For listing, supports `--contains` / `--no-contains` commit filters
//!   that BFS-walk the commit graph from each branch tip.

NOTES:
    `libra branch diff [<base>] [<branch>]` is a Libra verb — tip-to-tip diff
    (see `libra branch diff --help`); `diff` is reserved as a branch name here.

    Libra's global --quiet suppresses the branch listing itself.
    This differs from `git branch --quiet`, which still prints the primary list.
