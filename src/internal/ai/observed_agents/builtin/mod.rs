//! Stable [`ObservedAgent`](super::ObservedAgent) adapters built into the
//! libra binary. Distinct from `super::preview` which holds the v1
//! preview stubs that return `Err(AgentNotYetImplemented)` for the
//! transcript / hook code paths.
//!
//! Phase 4 (entire.md §14.4) populates this module incrementally; the
//! first entrant is `claude_code`, paired with a `TranscriptTruncator`
//! capability that `libra agent checkpoint rewind --apply` calls.
