//! Workspace strategy selection for sub-agent isolated workspaces
//! (CEX-S2-11).
//!
//! This module owns the **pure policy** that picks which materialization
//! strategy a sub-agent should use for its isolated workspace, given the
//! source repository's size. It deliberately carries no I/O: the actual
//! materialization (Libra/Git worktree reservation, sparse checkout, or
//! full copy) lands in a later CEX-S2-11 slice that wires
//! `orchestrator/workspace.rs` into the sub-agent dispatcher.
//!
//! The thresholds come from `docs/development/tracing/agent.md` (Step 2 workspace
//! materialization table):
//!
//! | condition                                   | strategy   |
//! |---------------------------------------------|------------|
//! | `.git` < 1 GiB **and** files < 100K         | `Worktree` |
//! | files ≥ 100K **or** `.git` ≥ 1 GiB          | `Sparse`   |
//! | preferred strategy unavailable **and** user | `FullCopy` |
//! | set `agent.allow_full_copy = true`          |            |
//!
//! [`WorkspaceStrategy::Blocked`] is not produced here — it is a *runtime*
//! decision raised when a sub-agent write escapes the materialized scope,
//! not a selection-time outcome.
