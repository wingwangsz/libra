//! Branch storage layer.
//!
//! All branch state for a Libra repository lives in the SQLite `reference` table
//! (kind = `Branch`). This module is the only place that should mutate that table
//! for branch-shaped rows; callers go through [`Branch::find_branch`],
//! [`Branch::update_branch`], etc.
//!
//! The public API comes in two flavours:
//! - **Lossy wrappers** (e.g. `find_branch`, `list_branches`) — collapse storage
//!   errors into `None` / empty results, suitable for decoration paths where the
//!   alternative would be to abort a `git log` rendering.
//! - **`*_result` and `*_with_conn` variants** — return [`BranchStoreError`] so that
//!   transactional callers (`update_branch_with_conn` inside a `db.transaction(...)`)
//!   can roll back on failure. See the block comment above [`Branch`] for the
//!   `_with_conn` deadlock rule.
//!
//! Concurrency: SQLite serialises writers, so update/delete operations include
//! a bounded retry loop ([`SQLITE_BUSY_MAX_RETRIES`]) for transient `database is
//! locked` errors that show up under multi-task contention.

/*
 * =================================================================================
 * NOTE: Transaction Safety Pattern (`_with_conn`)
 * =================================================================================
 *
 * This module follows the `_with_conn` pattern for transaction safety.
 *
 * - Public functions (e.g., `find_branch`, `update_branch`) acquire a new database
 *   connection from the pool and are suitable for single, non-transactional operations.
 *
 * - `*_with_conn` variants (e.g., `find_branch_with_conn`, `update_branch_with_conn`)
 *   accept an existing connection or transaction handle (`&C where C: ConnectionTrait`).
 *
 * **WARNING**: To use these functions within a database transaction (e.g., inside
 * a `db.transaction(|txn| { ... })` block), you MUST call the `*_with_conn`
 * variant, passing the transaction handle `txn`. Calling a public version from
 * inside a transaction will try to acquire a second connection from the pool,
 * leading to a deadlock.
 *
 * Correct Usage (in a transaction): `Branch::update_branch_with_conn(txn, ...).await;`
 * Incorrect Usage (in a transaction): `Branch::update_branch(...).await;` // DEADLOCK!
