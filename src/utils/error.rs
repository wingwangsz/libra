//! User-facing CLI error rendering utilities.
//!
//! The CLI uses [`CliError`] as the single user-visible error type at the
//! process boundary. Domain errors inside commands should be mapped into
//! [`CliError`] with an explicit stable code, exit code, and hint set instead
//! of printing raw internal causes to stderr.
//!
//! Contract references for maintainers and AI agents:
//! - Stable rendering and JSON envelope: `docs/development/cli-error-contract-design.md`
//! - Public stable-code catalogue: `docs/error-codes.md`
//!
//! ## Anatomy of a CliError
//!
//! Each error carries five pieces of metadata that drive rendering:
//! - **kind** ([`CliErrorKind`]) — chooses the prefix (`fatal:`, `error:`, none).
//! - **stable_code** ([`StableErrorCode`]) — machine-readable identifier (`LBR-...`)
//!   that maps to a [`CliErrorCategory`] and a default exit code.
//! - **message** — the primary human-readable line.
//! - **hints** — at most two trailing `Hint:`-prefixed lines.
//! - **usage** / **details** — optional usage block and structured key/value details.
//!
//! ## Rendering modes
//!
//! - `render` — single-line prefixed output for human consumption.
//! - `render_json` — structured envelope used in `--json` mode and when
//!   `LIBRA_ERROR_JSON=1` forces structured stderr.
//! - `render_report` — combines both, emitting the human line and a trailing JSON
//!   payload so log scrapers can parse the same line a developer is reading.
//!
//! ## Exit-code resolution
//!
//! By default the exit code follows the Git convention: 128 for fatal runtime
//! errors and 129 for usage errors. Setting `LIBRA_FINE_EXIT_CODES=1` switches to
//! the legacy 2..=9 category codes for backward compatibility with old scripts.
//! `with_exit_code` overrides everything else, used when matching Git's quirky
//! per-command codes (e.g. `git config --get` returning 1).
